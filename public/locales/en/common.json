The start of our activity came as a reaction to the racially motivated human rights violations related to people fleeing from Ukrainian war zones. Currently, we are an association in formation: Tubman Network e.V. – Coalition of Black Organizations in Germany & Allies.",

At our location in Neukölln, we process requests from an average of 100 people per day. Since our work is financed exclusively by private donations, we also ask for your help!",
